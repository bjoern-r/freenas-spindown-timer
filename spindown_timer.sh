Usage: $0 [-h] [-q] [-v] [-d] [-m] [-t TIMEOUT] [-p POLL_TIME] [-i DRIVE]
Monitors drive I/O and forces HDD spindown after a given idle period.
Resistant to S.M.A.R.T. reads.
A drive is considered as idle and is spun down if there has been no I/O
operations on it for at least TIMEOUT seconds. I/O requests are detected
during intervals with a length of POLL_TIME seconds. Detected reads or
writes reset the drives timer back to TIMEOUT.
Options:
  -q           : Quiet mode. Outputs are suppressed if flag is present.
  -v           : Verbose mode. Prints additonal information during execution.
  -d           : Dry run. No actual spindown is performed.
  -m           : Manual mode. If this flag is set, the automatic drive detection
                 is disabled.
                 This inverts the -i switch which then needs to be used to supply
                 each drive to monitor. All other drives will be ignored.
  -t TIMEOUT   : Number of seconds to wait for I/O in total before considering
                 a drive as idle.
  -p POLL_TIME : Number of seconds to wait for I/O during a single iostat call.
  -i DRIVE     : In automatic drive detection mode (default): Ignores the given
                 drive and never issue a spindown command for it.
                 In manual mode [-m]: Only monitor the specified drives.
                 Multiple drives can be given by repeating the -i switch.
  -h           : Print this help message.
Example usage:
$0
$0 -q -t 3600 -p 600 -i ada0 -i ada1
$0 -q -m -i sda -i sdb -i hda
